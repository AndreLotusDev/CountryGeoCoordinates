### Code Explanation
1. **Import Statement**: The code imports `CountriesLocalService` from a local file. This service is assumed to provide country-related data.

2. **Service Instance**: An instance of `CountriesLocalService` is created, named `countriesServices`.

3. **Function Definition**: `getByCountryCode` is defined as a function that takes a `countryCode` parameter and returns a `Promise`.

4. **Local Service Check**: The function first tries to get the country information from the local service using the country code. 

5. **Promise Resolution**: If the country information is available locally (not null or undefined), it immediately returns a resolved Promise with this information.

6. **External API Request**: If the local service does not have the information, the function constructs a URL to make an API request to `restcountries.com`.

7. **Fetch API Call**: The function then uses the `fetch` API to make an HTTP GET request to the constructed URL.

8. **Response Handling**: Upon receiving the response, it converts the response to JSON and extracts the latitude and longitude (`latlng`) of the country.

9. **Information Structuring**: The latitude and longitude are then structured into a new object, `countryInfo`, and returned.

10. **Error Handling**: If there is an error during the fetch operation, it logs the error to the console.

# Country Information Service

## Overview
This service provides information about countries based on their country codes. It utilizes a local data service and an external API for comprehensive coverage.

## Features
- Fetch country information using country codes.
- Leverages local data for quick access.
- Falls back to an external API (`restcountries.com`) for wider coverage.

## Usage
Import the service and call the `getByCountryCode` function with a country code as an argument to receive country information, including latitude and longitude.

### Example
```javascript
import { getByCountryCode } from './path-to-your-service';

getByCountryCode('US').then(countryInfo => {
  console.log(countryInfo);
});

## Error Handling
Errors during data retrieval are logged to the console for debugging.

## Dependencies
- `CountriesLocalService`: Local service for initial data retrieval.

## External API
- `restcountries.com`: Used when local data is unavailable.
